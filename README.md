# c-mpi-geometric-mean
The MPI (Message-Passing Interface) program, written in C, for a distributed memory system  demonstrates the allocation of work to multiple processes and the combination of work from multiple processes.  An overall geometric mean is the nth root of the product of n elements.  The work of finding the product of n elements is allocated among multiple processes.
